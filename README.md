# INTRODUCTION

This is my first take in building a website as patterned to the Odin Landing Page.

## PROGRESS

July 31 - Setting up the html and css documents
August 1 - Did the html and css of the website. Still needs a few tweaks in the css but I can say I'm done (with the website portion though). I'm planning to make it reponsive next time.
